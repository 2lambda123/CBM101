## Setting up your system

**Follow the instructions at [Setting up your system](../setup.md) (`setup.md`) to get ready**


## Notebooks
The course is based on the Jupyter Notebook, a web-based framework for developing and presenting code-based projects (take a look at https://youtu.be/HW29067qVWk and https://youtu.be/2eCHD6f_phE for introductions to Jupyter Notebooks, and A. Rule et al. _Ten simple rules for writing and sharing computational analyses in Jupyter Notebooks_. [PLOS Computational Biology, July 25 2019](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007007)).

Throughout the course you will work with notebooks that contain various material and programming tasks. We recommend that you *make a copy of our notebooks before you are editing them*. In this respect you might adopt the naming convention `my_[name_of_notebook].ipynb`.
