### Key things to know about Python

Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. It is a general-purpose open-source programming language and relative easy to learn, making it at very beginner-friendly language.

Python comes with a whole repository of software for the python programming language; the repository is called PiPy and contains ready to use script “modules” (files made up of Python code) that let you skip the process of coding these functions yourself. You simply import the modules at the beginning of your script and "call" the functions when needed. Examples of such modules are NumPy for advanced mathematical functionalities, Pandas for processing data in tables and Matplotlib for plotting graphs like histograms and scatter plots. We will look at some of these later.

To give you an example print() is a built-in function that outputs whatever you pass to it, such as a simple string. A string is a type of object that you'd typically write between quotes in code, and generally represents actual written text. Guess what this line of code will output:

print("Hello Universe")

By loading Pipy, Pandas, Numpy or other modules, you will have additional functions available to use.
