### Short Course summary  

The course will introduce the students to computational biomedicine. The goal of the course is to teach the students about important tools and data resources in this field, and to demonstrate through applications what basic knowledge in network analysis, statistics and machine learning they will need to work with and understand results from high-throughput biomedical experiments (imaging and omics). For each topic there will be text and/or video material and mcq or other types of activities and hands-on data analysis exercises in Jupyter notebook format.
