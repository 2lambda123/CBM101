This K_Mathematical_Modeling chapter is about standard techniques used in mathematical modeling of biological systems. 
It includes 5 section:
- Section 0: introduction
- Section 1: Building the model structure
- Section 2: Animating the structure, time and space dependent modeling
- Section 3: Animating the structure, stochastic modeling
- Section 4: Feeding the model, model parameters
